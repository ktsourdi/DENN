# DENN Project

Decentralized News Network project.
Its main goal is to fight fake news and create a network where third parties' verification is not necessary. 
This becomes possible with the use of blockchain technology and C2PA technology. 

The current beta version only represents the web UI, simplified. 

Running on test server: http://159.89.25.80:3000/
